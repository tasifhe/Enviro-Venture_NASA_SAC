## Project Overview

This educational game is an immersive, open-world experience designed to teach players about flood management, environmental challenges, and community resilience. Players take on the role of Araf, a character whose locality has been hit by a devastating flood, leading to various environmental and community issues.

## Key Features

- **Open-World Exploration**: Navigate through a flood-affected village and surrounding areas.
- **Multiple Environmental Challenges**: Address issues such as water pollution, agricultural damage, and mosquito infestations.
- **Data-Driven Gameplay**: Collect and analyze data using in-game tools and real-time NASA API integration.
- **Resource Management**: Start with limited coins and equipment, unlock more as you progress.
- **Community Interaction**: Fulfill community requests, trade resources, and make decisions that impact the locals.
- **Real-world Integration**: Utilizes GLOBE protocols and NASA Earth-Observation Satellite Data for authenticity.

## Gameplay Mechanics

1. **Character Introduction**: Araf guides players through the game, explaining controls and setting the scene.
2. **Issue Selection**: Players choose which environmental issue to tackle first.
3. **Investigation Phase**: Collect data using various tools and equipment.
4. **Decision Making**: Analyze data and make choices to address the selected issue.
5. **Resource Management**: Use coins to purchase equipment, build systems, or fulfill community needs.
6. **Progression**: Unlock new areas, repair damaged infrastructure, and earn more resources as you advance.

## Environmental Challenges

- **Water Quality Analysis**: Collect water samples, analyze using GLOBE Hydrosphere Protocols.
- **Mosquito Habitat Identification**: Locate and assess mosquito populations using Biosphere Protocols.
- **Weather Pattern and Flood Risk Analysis**: Predict future flood risks using weather data.
